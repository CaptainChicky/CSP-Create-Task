# AP CSP Create Task
This is the create task for my AP CSP class, which I have polished recently.

# Structure
`index.html` is the create task which I submitted. It is a fair bit different from the actual version I submitted as I've recently improved the html and ui, and organized the repo. The game that the `index.html` loads in is stored in the various js files in `/js/`, and the sprites which are drawn (dino, eggs) are located in `/sprites/`. It's a shitty game, don't expect much fun out of it lol. The code for this game is incredibly janky, as I literally haven't touched the canvas API until actually starting the project.

Because I just started learning the API, I've also documented me experimenting with the api in `tests.html` that displays two canvases. First is a drawing test with a controllable triangle, and second is animating bouncing balls with gravity and friction. The js for this is in `/junk/`.
