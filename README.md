# Comp Sci Principles Archive
This is an archive of the create task, and two minor projects for my AP CSP class, which I have polished recently.

# Structure
## Create Task
`index.html` is the create task which I submitted. It is a fair bit different from the actual version I submitted as I've recently improved the html and ui, and organized the repo. The game that the `index.html` loads in is stored in the various js files in `/js/`, and the sprites which are drawn (dino, eggs) are located in `/sprites/`. It's a shitty game, don't expect much fun out of it lol. The code for this game is incredibly janky, as I literally haven't touched the canvas API until actually starting the project.

Because I just started learning the API, I've also documented me experimenting with the api in `tests.html` that displays two canvases. First is a drawing test with a controllable triangle, and second is animating bouncing balls with gravity and friction. The js for this is in `/junk/`.

## How the Internet Works
`index.html` is the main page, and it's literally just a normal website. I was basically tasked to make a website to explain the internet with a group of 3 other people, and had to include several vocab words (in blue in the website). That's literally it.

## Webdev Intro
`index.html` is the main entry page. This is basically a first-project type thing the teacher assigned, where you create a webpage (I believe I initially put it on replit when it was good lol) with several required html tag elements. I kinda went with a shitposty type webpage, see as follows.
